                        <hr>
                        <p>Natural soap, whether stirctly organic or just botanical, is an all-round hero in our opinion.  It looks good because the artisans go above and beyond to present it well, it smells great, as the soap makers use non-toxic, natural fragrances which have been extracted over a slow process from flowers, roots and stems, and they are intentionally enriched with skin loving natural ingredients which result in a compelling piece of cleansing bar.  Yet, does no harm to the environment nor to the skin.  No trade off!  It wows and delights!</p>

                        <h3>How is soap made?<i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i></h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Ordinary soap is made by combining fats or oils and an alkali, typically as lye. The fats and oils, which may be from animal, vegetable, or mineral sources, are broken down into fatty acids, which then mix with the alkali to form crude soap, basically.  All natural soaps have lye as an ingredient in them; synthetic chemicals are now be used by factories instead of lye.  What is produced is really not soap but a chemical detergent.  We are bring real soap back with natural soap. </p>

                        <h3>Is natural soap really safe, and especially for infants?</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Broadly speaking yes!  However, like every profession, the competence levels of the soap maker and their adherance to safety standards and good production procedures, can compromise the end product if there are any complacencies.  Alway ask for qualification and test certificates.</p>

                        <h3>When was soap invented? <i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell"></i></h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>2800BC.  There are recordings dating back 4800 years to the Sumer region in Bronze Age Mesopotamia, now southern Iraq.  These texts from that era describe ways of making soap from the resin of fir trees.  Similarly, there are 5000 year-old folk tales from Ghana in west Africa of making soap with banana ash, The African Black soap.</p>

                    <h3>Can I trust soap that is handmade? <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i></h3>
                    <hr>   
                    <p>Natural soap makers prioritize ethical production methods and transparency.  These qualities are of the highest importance to the demographic that favour natural soap, making it safer to the consumer to know fully all the information about the ingredients added and even the particular production method used.  This openness and transparency puts back power in the hands of the consumers, allowing them make informed decisions that align with their personal values.</p>

                        <h3>Why is Natural soap more expensive?<i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i></h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Natural ingredients cost more than synthetic chemicals.  Just imagine the cost of your grocery shopping if you only bought organic; therefore the soap is more expensive to make.  Furthermore, it is made by hand, instead of machines, so a more laborious process, although lovingly undertaken, and usually in small batches.  It has been said that no two bars of the same batch are exactly the same.  Well, all this takes more time, more money and physical effort than factory made with machine soaps.  Mass production also uses  cheap inferior ingredients.  The packaging too for Natural soaps are also made by hand.</p>

                        <h3>Does soap remove 100% of germs? <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i></h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Soap and water don't kill germs; they work by mechanically removing them from your hands. Running water by itself does a pretty good job of germ removal, but soap increases the overall effectiveness by pulling unwanted material off the skin and into the water.</p>
                        
                        <p> Here is a short video clip explaining how effective bar soap is in compasrison to hand sanitisers and liquid soap in removing germs.  enjoy"</p>
